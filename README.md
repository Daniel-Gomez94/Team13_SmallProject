# Team13_SmallProject
Small project repo for team 13

### Database (Daniel Gomez) ###
- Designed the schema (`schema_clean.sql`) for Users and Contacts tables.
- Enforced foreign key with ON DELETE CASCADE so when a user is deleted, their contacts are removed automatically.
- Added unique constraints (e.g., each user cannot have duplicate emails).
- Created indexes for fast searching by name, email, and phone.
- Built the ERD (`ERD.pdf`) to visualize relationships between Users and Contacts.
- Verified schema with sample data inserts for testing.

- ### Project Management (Daniel Gomez) ###
- Set up Trello board for task tracking and team coordination.
- Created Gantt chart to show weekly milestones and deadlines.
- Organized repo structure into `database/`, `api/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, and `management/`.
- Ensured deliverables (ERD, schema, presentation skeleton) were ready early for teammates.
